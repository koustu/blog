# Hugo vs. WordPress – Which One is Right for You? 🆚  

If you're planning to start a blog, **Hugo** and **WordPress** are two great options. But which one should you choose? Let's compare:  

| Feature         | Hugo 🏗️ | WordPress 📝 |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Speed ⚡      | Super Fast (Static) | Slower (Dynamic) |
| Customization 🎨 | High (Markdown + Templates) | High (Themes & Plugins) |
| Ease of Use 👨‍💻 | For Developers | Beginner-Friendly |
| Hosting 💻 | Free on Netlify/GitHub Pages | Needs Hosting (like Bluehost) |
| Security 🔒 | More Secure | Can be Vulnerable |

### **🚀 My Recommendation**  
✅ If you love **customization & speed**, go with **Hugo**.  
✅ If you prefer a **ready-to-go CMS**, choose **WordPress**.
